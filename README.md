# Matplotlib Analysis
Uber Analysis Via Matplotlib 
##Pyber Data Analysis 
In this assignment, two csv files containing information of rides, fares, drivers, cities and type of cities, were utilized. The created dataframe allowed one to see that urban cities had the largest amount of drivers, riders and fares. The result of the data corrilates with what is expected of urban metrapolitan cities. Suburban cities followed the trend of usage and spenditure behind urban cities. As expected rural cities had the drastic lower amount of riders, drivers and fares. This expectation comes from the assumption that in larger distance traveling majority of residents will own their own method of transportation, not needing to utilize this service. 
## Pyber Code Utilized 
The main syntax utilized for the analysis and data plotting were the following:
  .merge() to conmbine csv files to create a dataframe
   to formulate a data frame pd.DataFrame() was used 
   .utilized .groupby() for data filetring 
   .used plt.pie and plt.scatter to create graphs to show the data
